#### My STM32F4Discovery blank project on Linux& OS X

> Modified the makefile, that you could use the libraries fluently on linux or OS X.

#### toolchain

* arm-none-eabi-gcc(to compile the c code)
* stlink(to download bineries into board)
* arm-none-eabi-gdb(haven't tested)



> You could do whatever you want by this blank project, and you could adjust the file tree into your own preference. Have fun!
